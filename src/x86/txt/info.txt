client: master-id is stored in EEPROM
client power-up (bootloader code): Master-ID RTR, wait 3 sec, if no bootloader enter command received, check app CRC and start app
on app CRC error: Master-ID (0x ff 00 nn nn nn nn nn nn, where nn = bootloader ID [hardcoded in bootloader flash]) "merror" and then re-check in endless loop (but don't transmit any errors anymore)

(ff -> error, 00 = application crc error ^= no app or bootloader interrupted)


master
	client
--------------

(.. applies power)

	Master-ID RTR (-> power up) (if client receives, it cancels its own transmission of this) "mpowerup"

(.. waits 2 sec)

[.. wants to enter bootloader]

Master-ID (0x 01 d.c. nn nn nn nn nn nn, where nn = bootloader ID [hardcoded in bootloader flash]) "mboot"

	(.. enters bootloader)

[.. doesn't want to enter bootloader (usually)]

Master-ID (0x 00 d.c. nn nn nn nn nn nn, where nn = network ID [master ID], network ID must not be -1 (is returned from bootloader when no id received)) "mid"

	(bootloader -> app)
	[.. cached and received network IDs differ]
	Master-ID (0x 02 d.c. nn nn nn nn nn nn, where nn = bootloader ID) "mnew"

	(.. waits for further actions)

(.. asks user for further actions)

	[.. cached and received network IDs match, or no network ID received (network ID = ff ff ff ff ff ff)]
	(.. checks app crc, see above)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

after "mnew":

	(app)
	(.. waits for further actions)

Master-ID (0x 04 d.c. nn nn nn nn nn nn, where nn = boot-id) "mformat"

	(saves new network ID, "formats" EEPROM (= clears old CANid's))

======================================================================================================================================================

Master-ID RTR (0x 03 d.c. nn nn nn nn nn nn, where nn = bootloader ID of target) "mping", reply is without RTR ("mpong")
