todo PC
-------
- ../main Switch --> createRemoteHeader, createSendCode (gen. flash fct ptr), invoke avr-gcc on Switch.C

bootloader
----------
has unique CAN ID hardcoded in flash (separete source file generated and linked to bootloader), number should be printed (etched?) on PCB and on "case"

master
------
CAN-ID of master communication is 0x00000001 - stored in EEPROM, can be changed

if questioned (RTR master ID), master broadcasts the network ID (serial no. of master - 6 bytes)
if nodes detect a new network, the current IDs are not used but the master is informed that "new" nodes are on the bus.

the master issues CAN IDs for all incoming messages. outgoing message ids are read from eeprom too (generate config gui possibilities from commented eeprom source file?)

master may synchronize its clock to power grid frequency
