- yc_prepare() and _pack (calling outbound Message function) are an atomic
  operation (yc_prepare() stores data in a global variable). If an interrupt
  tries to transmit a message between yc_prepare() and _pack, the CAN-ID and
  packstyle will be lost.
  If it is really needed to transmit out of an INT, it should backup the
  CAN-ID and the packstyle (global variables in libyaca-bl/dispatch.c).

- The yaca library needs to be linked with a special linker script to place
  .biosram section somewhere defined. This area must then be left unused by
  the application, otherwise the communication data will be corrupted (FIFOs
  etc. are allocated by the bootloader in .biosram section of SRAM)
