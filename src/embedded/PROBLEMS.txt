O "Omitted Zeros Problem": the bootloader .hex file is too large, but the last few blocks are just 0's. If you remove them, things like global vars are not initialized correctly with 0 (?)...
	caused by BIOSRAM, this is not a problem as everything is properly initialized in yc_init()
	

-> Message.info must be 0 prior to transmission

Bootloader
----------
-> Timing: booting must neither be too early (eeprom warmup delay) nor too late (bootloader timeout)

Octopus
-------
-> When CAN isn't initialized, the outputs are high-Z -> no LED light in optocoupler -> bus dominant transmission...
-> transmission hangup in USB???
