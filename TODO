BUGS

-> pool-control: hangup (old: related to random messages? [yaca-gw get_sender() bug])
-> control-panel: hangup (related to yaca-gw SIGPIPE bug?)
-> yaca-c missing <build> bug


TODO

-> negative °C for PHP

-> log (write) revisions and CRC at flashing (to be able to check the current version in flash)
-> flow control, at least remove the current one from yaca-serial
-> yaca-logd should die if yaca-gw socket dies
-> fix message length problem in yaca-ppp, yaca-gw
-> check PoolControl for switching reliability
-> daemons should try to re-open socket connections if they go down
-> yaca-cached: currently serves 1 client only

-> yaca-timed, yaca-cached, (yaca-ppp?) should be integrated into yaca-gw
-> yaca-cached: fixed bug introduced by merging in new network.cpp (needs further elaboration)


CHECK / should be fixed

-> yaca-gw: dies after some time
	-> FIXED: get_sender() could return other fd's like UART...
	-> FIXED: SIGPIPE killed process


HEIZUNG

-> Temperatursensoren: Vorlauf, Rücklauf, Warmwasser, Keller (main-power?) (KG), Wohnzimmer (EG), OG
-> Mindestlaufzeit für Brenner
-> Status-Anzeige: Sonne (Dauerheizung), Mond (Nachtbetrieb), Uhr (Programm)


=========================================================================


-> take apart a node (e.g. cut mcp2515 pins) and see what happens (app should continue without bus)
	-> enable INT pull-up!

-> "Read eeprom message" into libyaca
O> CHECK: 'info' of Message struct in yaca-serial?
O> "Enter bootloader message" into libyaca
O> libyaca: call init _Z4initv
0> yaca-serial: dead (no incoming msgs)
O> pool-control: timing problems
	0> libyaca register bug

?> yaca-cached: if socket to yaca-serial dies, endless loop - fix

LONG-TERM
^^^^^^^^^
-> fuses: enter them into makefile (??)
-> mcu type option
