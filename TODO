BUGS

-> yaca-c missing <build> bug


TODO

!> enable brownout detector for all nodes
-> make non-global variables static (i.e. remove visibility)
-> implement an automatic deploy-log to see what has been programmed, when and with which revision
-> sanity checks into Time to prevent wrong time from being Tx-ed

-> uart.c init should be called without the baud calculation (move calculation to macro or to init function)
!> yaca-logd should die if yaca-gw socket dies
-> fix message length problem in yaca-gw
-> daemons should try to re-open socket connections if they go down
-> yaca-cached: currently serves 1 client only

-> yaca-c: add MCU type option
-> should yaca-cached be integrated into yaca-gw?
-> yaca-cached: fixed bug introduced by merging in new network.cpp (needs further elaboration)

!> create a CAN tx timeout to prevent lockups when not on bus, this is critical for stable bus-off operation, whether caused by a cable problem or by MCP2515 is irrelevant
-> set 'info' of Message struct to 0 in yc_transmit() - prevents a lot of nasty 'info' bugs easily

?> yaca-cached: if socket to yaca-serial dies, endless loop - fix

-> fuses: enter them into makefile
-> Makefiles for all yaca-c compiled embedded src

-> yaca-serial FIFO 'count' might need an atomic access


HEIZUNG

-> Temperatursensoren: Vorlauf, Rücklauf, Warmwasser, Keller (main-power?) (KG), OG
-> Mindestlaufzeit für Brenner
-> Status-Anzeige: Sonne (Dauerheizung), Mond (Nachtbetrieb), Uhr (Programm)
